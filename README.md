# BBO Faucet [![CI](https://github.com/BcnBitcoinOnly/bbo-faucet/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/BcnBitcoinOnly/bbo-faucet/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A feature-complete fork of [@kallewoof]'s [bitcoin-faucet] built on the PHP+Redis stack, to serve the [BBO signet network].

## Features

* Instant or batched payouts
* User/Pass or cookie RPC authentication
* Optional faucet captcha
* Optional faucet password
* Customizable mempool URL
* Customizable minimum and maximum one-time payout amounts
* Customizable global and per-IP payout limits (both can be disabled)
* Customizable time window to enforce the limits (i.e. limits cooldown time)

## Requirements

* [PHP-FPM 8.3] daemon with the `redis`, `gd` and `mbstring` extensions enabled.
* An HTTP webserver with FastCGI support (Caddy, nginx, Apache etc.)
* [Composer] dependency manager
* Bitcoin node running in signet mode (Core or Knots) with RPC enabled and a wallet with unspent funds
* Redis instance

## Installation

### Bare Metal (production)

1. Set up a Redis instance
2. Set up a signet network on a Bitcoin Core or Knots node. This node should have a wallet that receives the mining rewards or otherwise plenty of funds to give out. You can refer to [BcnBitcoinOnly/signet-playground](https://github.com/BcnBitcoinOnly/signet-playground) for more information.
3. Clone this project, checkout the latest tag and install the PHP dependencies with `composer install --no-dev --classmap-authoritative`
4. Set up a webserver with FastCGI support and configure it properly, including the faucet's environment variables (see below). Caddy is recommended for its ease of use.

### Docker (development)

For development tasks Docker, the PHP CLI and Composer are assumed to be installed locally.
The development stack runs containerized Caddy and PHP-FPM containers, but Composer is used as a task runner tool.

```shell
$ docker compose up -d
$ composer install
$ composer setup
```

After these commands the faucet will be available at `http://localhost:8080`, and set up with a regtest node with a wallet and 101 blocks already mined.

The `composer.json` file also has tasks for generating bitcoin addresses, mining new blocks and running the linter and the test suite.

To customize the Docker stack create a `compose.override.yml` at the root. On `docker compose up -d` it'll be automatically merged with `compose.yml`.
Example, with custom environment variables and exposed Redis port for debugging:

```yaml
name: faucet

services:
  php-fpm:
    env_file:
      - .env
  redis:
    ports:
      - 127.0.0.1:6379:6379
```

To customize the default environment variables create an `.env` file and set it up as an extra `env_file` for `php-fpm` as shown above.
Example:

```
FAUCET_USE_CAPTCHA=1
FAUCET_PASSWORD_BCRYPT_HASH='$2y$10$MyYyMkeWk2v4tvzA5lylyuWBsBXsvOfcGeCG61C9mVOdXDx1/BnyO'
```

Changing environment variables requires recreating the `php-fpm` container.

## Configuration
